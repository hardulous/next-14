ROUTING ::

There are 2 types of routing in next.JS v-14 depending on what you choose while creating a next.js project, App Router or Page Router, The Page Router (used via the /pages directory) is still available and improved in Next.js 14. It's designed for projects that rely on the classic file-based routing and has full support for both static generation and server-side rendering.


#### APP ROUTER ####

1. Next.JS has a file-based routing mechanism, Where URL paths that user can access in the browser are defined by files and folders in your codebase. 

2. All routes must be placed inside the app folder, Every file that corresponds to a route must be named page.js or page.tsx, Every folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL a user can access where name of the path is same as folder name. When all these conventions are followed the file automatically available as a route with name same as the folder name where this file is present. 

 (a). Scenario-1 => To create a home page route for our application all we need to do is create a "page.tsx" file in the root of app directory. NOTE:: if we try to delete layout.tsx file at root of app folder it will be automatically created as it is the entry point of our application (similar to _app.js) which need to be present

 (b). Scenario-2 => Now our app have t additional route "/about" or "/profile", So all we have to do is create 2 folder one with name about and other with name profile and have a page.tsx file that export default a component and we are done.
